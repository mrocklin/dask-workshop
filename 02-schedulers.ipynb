    "In the previous notebook we used Dask.delayed to create computations.  By default, these ran on a local thread pool.  Often, this is sufficient, especially when you are bound by NumPy and Pandas routines which release the GIL and when you are using powerful workstation computers with many cores.\n",

However, if you are unfamiliar with the command line you can safely skip this section and go down to the Automatic section below. We run the `dask-scheduler` process on one machine.\n",

If you are doing mostly GIL-released computations (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) then this is the right choice.
